I used the link below to finish the webpack boilerplate quicker [https://stanko.github.io/webpack-babel-react-revisited/](https://stanko.github.io/webpack-babel-react-revisited/)

I like to keep my packages' versions to strict releases inside `package.json`. I check for outdated ones with `yarn outdated` and update manually.
